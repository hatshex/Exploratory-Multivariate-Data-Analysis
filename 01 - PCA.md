- In principal component analysis, 
  + the variables are quantitative
  + we try to summarize the similarities between individuals
  + two individuals are close if they have similar values for all variables
  + we look at linear relationships between variables
- The correlation coefficient reveals relationships between quantitative variables
- If we do a principal component analysis of a table with I individuals and K columns,
  + each individual has K values and can be considered a point in a K-dimensional space 
  + the set of individuals forms a cloud of I points in a K-dimensional space
  + the set of columns, i.e., the set of variables, can be seen as a cloud of K points in an I-dimensional space
